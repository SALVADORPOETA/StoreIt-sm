# StoreIt

This cloud storage management application, inspired by platforms like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive, was developed following a tutorial by the YouTube channel JavaScript Mastery. The app features secure passwordless OTP authentication, a responsive and intuitive dashboard for tracking storage usage and recent activity, and robust file management capabilities including multi-file uploads, renaming, previews, downloads, deletions, and sharing. It also supports global search, filtering, detailed file views, and role-based access control to manage user permissions effectively across devices.

This project showcases end-to-end fullstack development skills, covering backend architecture, authentication flows, database design, file handling, and modern UI principles. Performance optimization and responsive design were key focuses, ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes. Technologies used include Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ShadCN/UI, Chart.js, and Appwrite.
